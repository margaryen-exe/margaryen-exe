Hello! 👋 
My name is Margaret, Maggie for short. I am a data analyst. Tools that I use for data cleaning, editing and visualization include Microsft Excel and PowerBi. I am also passionate about Database Management Systems using SQL and Python languages!


- 💻I’m currently working on my database management skills. Still learning but I will be posting my works here soon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some languages for the fun of it: Italian, French and Japanese.
- 👩🏾‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on data cleaning and visualization processes using just Excel and Powerbi for now.
- 👌🏾 I am open to pointers and corrections regarding my repositories and my contributions to any repositories on here.
